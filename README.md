# Greenlight

## Details
Code + read-along with Let's Go Further by Alex Edwards. Some notes are kept in for further reference.

## Usage
There's a Makefile. The deps for the project use Docker (the book asks to install things locally, but I said no thank you.)

Run `docker compose up -d` to start the database (may be more stuff in future? COME BACK HERE LATER EDWARD)

To connect to the database run `make connect-db`
